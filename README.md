Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a recognition system for seven-segment displays using neural networks. Seven-segment displays are commonly used to represent digits in electronic devices such as digital clocks, calculators, and measuring instruments. The system aims to accurately detect and classify the digits (0-9) displayed on a seven-segment display by utilizing image processing techniques combined with the power of neural networks for pattern recognition.

Objective

The main objective is to build a neural network model capable of recognizing digits from seven-segment displays by analyzing visual input. This system will be robust enough to handle variations in brightness, noise, and potential distortions in the display images. The solution is designed to be highly efficient for real-time applications, where fast and accurate digit recognition is essential.
